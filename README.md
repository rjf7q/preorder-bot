# Automated-Bot
This is a Automated preordering bot made in python using Selenium. After the events that occurred with the Nvidia RTX 3080 my curiosity peaked and decided to make a script of my own, trying my hand in the technology.

1. The config file is where you enter all relevant shipping and billing information
2. There are two scripts
   - NeweggBot.py
   - BestbuyBot.py
   

# How To Setup
1.  Copy the link [https://github.com/QuinnyBoy-TT/Automated-Bot.git]
2.  Perform a **git clone** in your systems designated directory
3.  Perform a pip install on the requirments.text
    - **pip install -r requirements.txt**
